# Biological Neuron
"""

- The biological neuron is the basic building block of the human brain.
- The biological neuron consists of a cell body, dendrites, and an axon.
- The cell body contains the nucleus and other organelles.
- The dendrites receive signals from other neurons.
- The axon transmits signals to other neurons.
- The biological neuron communicates with other neurons through synapses.
- The synapse is the connection between two neurons.
- The synapse allows the transmission of signals from one neuron to another.
- The biological neuron receives signals from other neurons through synapses.
- The biological neuron integrates the signals it receives and generates an output signal.
- The output signal is transmitted to other neurons through the axon.
- The biological neuron can be in an active state or an inactive state.
- The biological neuron can change its state based on the signals it receives.
- The biological neuron can learn from experience and adapt to new situations.
- The biological neuron is the basic unit of information processing in the human brain.
